# etiq-core demo materials

The etiqai library enables users to identify and mitigate bias in predictive models. The library is similar to pytorch or sklearn libraries, with a battery of metrics and debiasing algorithms available to find the best debiasing method for the problem at hand. In this repo you'll find demo notebooks for the library.
