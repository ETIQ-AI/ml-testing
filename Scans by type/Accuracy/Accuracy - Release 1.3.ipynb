    "\n",
    "Accuracy is what I optimize my models on. Why should I have tests on accuracy metrics as well?\n",
    "\n",
    "- High accuracy can be indicative of a problem, just as much as low accuracy is. For instance, if a plain accuracy metric is 10% higher than you've expected, you might have leakage somewhere or another issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimizing for a metric pre-production does not equate to optimizing for that metric in production. You will be better off getting a good model off the ground, a model with no obvious issues, and which is likely to be robust, than trying to achieve a 1% accuracy with an overfitting model, a model which is unfairly discriminating against protected demographic groups or with a model that will experience abrupt performance decay. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our accuracy scans so far provide 3 metrics: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. accuracy - % correct out of total \n",
    "\n",
    "2. true positive rate - the proportion positive outcome labels that are correctly classified out of all positive outcome labels\n",
    "\n",
    "3. true negative rate -  the proportion negative outcome labels that are correctly classified out of all negative outcome labels\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But you can use custom metrics to add your own metrics."

    "However if this is not the case for your use case, you should NOT encode prior to splitting your sample, as this might lead to LEAKAGE.\n",

    "Encoding categorical values itself is problematic as it assigns a numerical ranking to categorical variables. For best practice encoding, use one-hot encoding which converts each categorical value into a new categorical column and assigns a binary value of 0 or 1 to those columns. As we limit the free library functionality to 15 features, we will not do one-hot encoding for the purposes of this example.\n",
