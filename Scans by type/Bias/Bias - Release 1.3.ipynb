    "# What is bias? And why it matters?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, bias refers to algorithmic bias. \"Algorithmic bias\" refers to unintended discrimination occurring as a result of an automated decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "Legislation defines a series of protected features. For example, in the UK, citizens are protected against discrimination on the basis of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation status by the Equality Act 2010. \n",
    "\n",
    "The unprivileged group within the protected feature (for example, people over 65 when age is the protected feature) tends to be discriminated against and as a result tends to be the one protected by legislation. The privileged group within the protected feature tends to not be discriminated against.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not tackling this issue, not only is your model potentially unethical, discriminating unintentionally and at risk from a compliance point of view, but also you are potentially leaving customer groups underserved and thus leaving money on the table. \n",

    "To illustrate some of the library's features, we build a model that predicts whether an applicant makes over or under 50K using the Adult dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult.\n",

    "\n",
    "Remember: This is an example only. The use case for the majority of scans in Etiq is that you log the model to Etiq once you have the sample that you'll be training on. Usually this sample will have numeric features only as otherwise you will not be able to use it in with the majority of supported libraries training methods."
